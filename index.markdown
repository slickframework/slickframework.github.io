## What is Slick?
---
A Slick application consists of a [PSR-15](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15/) HTTP middleware stack that can help you create web applications or web services for HTTP protocol.

It offers a router, security and a dispatcher that returns [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) Responses for HTTP Requests (usually through a web server).

You can change (add or remove) the HTTP stack by adding your own middleware making
this library very flexible and suitable for almost any HTTP handling needs.
